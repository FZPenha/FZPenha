## Welcome to my GitHub Profile

### About myself:

Graduate in Production Engineering at the College of Engineering of Guaratinguetá, institute of the University Estadual Paulista "Júlio de Mesquita Filho" (UNESP).

Former President and Vice-President at IEEE Computer Society - Guaratinguetá.
Currently an Intern at Peers Consulting.

I believe that trust, strength, responsibility, transparency and integrity are essential to human development, being it personal or team-oriented.
For me it's all about the challenge, so being that my biggest motivations are solving problems and helping people.

I seek solutions to problems in the most diverse areas, especially engineering, business and software development. Through my experiments/projects (that you can see most here at [Github](https://github.com/FZPenha)) I am building an arsenal of knowledge and analytical techniques & abilities so that I can be able to help as many people as possible!
