## Welcome to my GitHub Profile

### About myself:

Graduating in Production Engineering at the College of Engineering of Guaratinguetá, institute of the University Estadual Paulista "Júlio de Mesquita Filho" (UNESP).

Vice-President at IEEE - Computer Society - Guaratinguetá.

I believe that trust, strength, responsibility, transparency and integrity are essential to human development, personal or team-oriented.
For me, it's all about the challenge and never giving up. I am fascinated by difficult problems, leadership and also decision making.

I seek solutions to problems in the most diverse areas especially engineering, business and software development. Through these experiments I am building an arsenal of analytical techniques and abilities to be a complete Web Developer.
